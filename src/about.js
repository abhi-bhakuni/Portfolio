                Warm welcome to all of you!!!<br /><br /><br />
                My name is <b>Abhishek Bhakuni</b> and a passionate <b>Full-Stack Web Developer</b> eager to craft engaging and impactful online experiences.<br /><br />
                Coding and programming are more than just technical skills for me. I love to build something new .<br /><br />
                I constantly try to explore new technologies, particularly in the exciting realms of <b>AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.</b><br /><br />
                But I'm not just all into coding and all! Beyond the screen, you'll find me diving into the world of content creation on my YouTube channel,<b> Kickoff Chaos</b>. It's my space to explore different ideas and connect with a wider audience.<br /><br />
                Apart from all this, you'll likely find me listening to some good music or catching a football game.<br /><br />
